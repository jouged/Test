# Bitcoin Prices - Test

Here you can find a small scrip to get CoinGecko's prices for bitcoin in Q1 2022 and save it in a mongo database. After that, the scrip will get the prices from the database and its average price every 5 days in the selected period, and then save that average price in the same mongo database.

In this repository you can find two notebooks. The first notebook has the step-by-step script, useful for a small exhibition. The second notebook has the script that seeks to implement an automated process.
